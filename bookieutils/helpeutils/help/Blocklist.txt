➤ Blocklist Module Usage Guide
----------------------------------

**Overview:**
→ The blocklist allows admins to define offensive words or phrases. If these are posted by non-admins in a group, they'll be automatically deleted. Admins can **lock** (add) or **unlock** (remove) phrases. All management commands must be invoked in private chat, after which the bot will ask which connected group to apply changes to. Blocked phrases are NOT saved per-message—they're checked in real time and deleted immediately.

**Admin Setup (once, in private chat):**

➤ Block Behavior (any user)
-----------------------------

• **When any non-command message appears in the group, blocklist does**:
 → 1) If the sender is an admin → do nothing (admin messages are exempt).
→  2) Lowercase the message text and check if any blocked phrase is a substring.
  →3) If a match is found, delete the message immediately (no warning).

➤ Notes
---------

→• Blocklists are stored permanently unless deleted

→• Use short, exact phrases (no leading/trailing whitespace). The match is substring-based, so “scum” blocks “This is scum!” or “not a scum-bucket,” but not “scummy” unless you also lock “scummy.”

→• Admins never have their messages deleted, even if they post a locked phrase.

→• All changes (lock/unlock) happen in real time; no history is kept of past messages.
